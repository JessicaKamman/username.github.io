## Showcase Jessica Kamman Work and Self Reflection 
During my tenure at Southern New Hampshire Univeristy I learned all basic coding Practices including Object Oriented Design, Algorithm and Data Structues and the use of Database. I also learned the use the follwing programming languages: 
* Java
* C++
* SQL
* MongoDB
* Phyton
* HTML

At the end of my tenure at SNHU I had to take my Capstone course where I was tasked in modifying my own projects with additonal enhancements. The enhancement showed my ability to think about the projects in a general term in order to figure out what a client might want in updates. During this class I showcased that I can come up with updates for a project by looking at the code. 


### Projects Enhencemnts for Capstone Coding Class 
1. Software Design and Engineering 
2. Algorithms and Data Structures
3. Data Bases

Within these three categories I have chosen one project and made a few enhancements and updated the project to follow best coding practices, Object Oriented Design and made the project more effcient. 
```
## Software Design and Engineering- Hashtable 
* This project showcases my proficency with C++ and advanced Algorthims and Data Sets
* The modifications made for this project includes: 
        1. Changing Modular 10 to Modular 100
        2. Added GetKey to retrieve and provide a key
        3. Added Search functionality for fund
* Within this project I showed that I am able to look at a existing project and enhance it with C++ and higher Advance Algorthims programming language
```

```
###Algorithms and Data Structure
* This project showcased my ability to change a full program from a non Object Oriented Design code to follow Object Oriented Design and best coding practices. 
* This project also shows my strength in making a program more efficent
* The modifactions made for this project include: 
      1.Updated code to follow Object Oriented Design by breaking down code into Methods
      2. Added the ability to add to memory 
      3.
