## Showcase Jessica Kamman Work and Self Reflection 
During my tenure at Southern New Hampshire Univeristy I learned all basic coding Practices including Object Oriented Design, Algorithm and Data Structues and the use of Database. I also learned the use the follwing programming languages: 
* Java
* C++
* SQL
* MongoDB
* Phyton
* HTML

At the end of my tenure at SNHU I had to take my Capstone course where I was tasked in modifying my own projects with additonal enhancements. The enhancement showed my ability to think about the projects in a general term in order to figure out what a client might want in updates. During this class I showcased that I can come up with updates for a project by looking at the code. 


### Projects Enhencemnts for Capstone Coding Class 
1. Software Design and Engineering 
2. Algorithms and Data Structures
3. Data Bases

Within these three categories I have chosen one project and made a few enhancements and updated the project to follow best coding practices, Object Oriented Design and made the project more effcient.
