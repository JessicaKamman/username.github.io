# Showcase Jessica Kamman Work, Self Reflection and Work History 
During my tenure at Southern New Hampshire Univeristy, I learned all of the basic coding practices including Object Oriented Design, Algorithm and Data Structures, and the use of Database. I also learned the use the follwing programming languages: 
* Java
* C++
* SQL
* MongoDB
* Phyton
* HTML

At the end of my tenure at SNHU, I had to take my capstone course where I was tasked in modifying my own projects with additonal enhancements. The enhancement showed my ability to think about the projects in a general term, in order to figure out what a client might want in updates. During this class, I was challenged to look at all of my projects through my tenure at SNHU, and pick out the courses that most showcase my programming knowledge. With the enhancements and projects I have chosen, I showed my knowledge on taking a project and strategically thinking of possible changes the project will need. I also showcased that I can take an older project with less effcient code, and change the code efficiently to make the project run more smoothly. My source code can be found at:

Before I decided to go back to school to attain my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I worked in the finance field with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Economics. During my finance tenure, I have worked with many different talents and personalities, that made me very versatile to work with any type of team.


## Projects Enhencemnts for Capstone Coding Class 
1. Software Design and Engineering 
2. Algorithms and Data Structures
3. Databases

Within these three categories, I have chosen one project and made a few enhancements and updated the 
project to follow best coding practices, Object Oriented Design and made the project more effcient. 

### Software Design and Engineering- Hashtable 
This project was created in Algorithm and Data Structure CS 260 Class. This class focused on utilizing C++ to 
learn more advanced common strucutes for maintaining data and algorithms, to sort and manipulate the data within. 
During this class, I was exposed to C++ for the first time, but I soon understood the similarities between C++ 
and the other programming languages such as Java. 
* This project showcases my proficency with C++ and advanced Algorthims and Data Sets
* The modifications made for this project include: 
        1. Changing Modular 10 to Modular 100
        2. Added GetKey to retrieve and provide a key
        3. Added search functionality for fund
* Within this project I showed that I am able to look at a existing project and 
        enhance it with C++ and higher advanced algorthims programming language
        
### Algorithms and Data Structure
This project was created during IT 145 Foundations of Application Development. 
This class heavily relies in the use of Java programming, and I learned the basic programming 
principles in this class. This was one of my first classes that taught me Java, and 
througout this course I learned coding concepts, such as the use of an Array. 
This class laid the ground foundation for my Software Engineering career. I have 
learned from taking this class, that I have found my preferred language. During my tenure 
at SNHU, I also learned the use of C++, Phyton and mySQL in detail.
* This project showcased my ability to change a full program from a non Object Oriented Design code, to 
follow Object Oriented Design and best coding practices. 
* This project also shows my strength in making a program more efficient
* The modifications made for this project include: 
      1.Updated code to follow Object Oriented Design by breaking down code into methods
      2. Added the ability to add to memory 
      3. Added a sickness Functionality that keeps track of illnesses for animals
      
  * The project also showcases my use with Java and my ability to use existing code and make 
  necessary enhancements accordingly. 

### Databases 
This project was created during my first Database slass at SNHU, DAD 220 Introduction through SQL. 
During this course, I was introduced to the basic queries that are done with mySQL. The class went 
into detail in creating databases, tables, as well as, deleting and joining tables. This class gave me a 
foundation for creating a database and running basic queries on a dataset. I also learned my
appreciation of this language, and that I like working with datasets. From this class, I decided 
to minor in Data Analytics to give me a high level insight on how data behaves. During the classes
that I took through my Data Analytics minor, I also learned the use of SAS, Tableau, JMP, and QlikView. 
* The database project showcases my ability to work with mySQL to build a database and make necessary 
        enhancements, in order to build out the database and functionality. 
* This project showcases adding more advanced mySQL code and the use of Inner Joins
* The modifications made for this project include: 
        1. Proving all codes for all tables within this dataset
        2. Added the like table to the database
        3. Added how many likes are per message and what contacts liked a message
